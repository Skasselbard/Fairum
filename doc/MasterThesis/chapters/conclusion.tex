What was the goal:
- find a mapping between rust and petri-nets
- find deadlocks in rust programs

What was done:
- find a fitting program representation to translate (mir)
- develop a set of rules to translate from representation to formalism
- develop rules for interfacing program logic (non-mir)
- alter mir representations connected to deadlocks (mutexes) 
  for flow analysis
- check the results with simple tests programs

What was found:
- some kinds of deadlocks can be found
- complex deadlocks need further improvement
- data representation can be improved

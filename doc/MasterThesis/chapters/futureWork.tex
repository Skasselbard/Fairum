\chapter{Future Work}
\label{future}
\begin{verbatim}
- model the short commings
    - thread emulation
    - data models
\end{verbatim}

\section{Verification}
\begin{verbatim}
    
- deadlocks
    - introduction of multi threading
        - paths have to join or
        - paths need own termination places
    - what cannot be detected
- mir generation tests
    - unconnected nodes
    - flow analysis
- automatic evaluation of wittiness path 
- high lvl Verification
    - requires other formulas
\end{verbatim}

\section{Translation optimization}
\begin{verbatim}
- track moved variables
    - refine the concept of locals and memory
- other abstraction level
    - more complex: high lvl nets
    - less complex: basic blocks as places
        - statements currently do not influence the graph anyway
        - maybe track data that is important for flow
- map the source to the nodes similar to the mir approach
- analyse complex programs
